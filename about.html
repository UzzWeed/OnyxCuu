            <h1>Justification</h1>
            <p>We find ourselves in a society and in a present time which due to the contingency 
                has closed many doors but also has opened new ones. The Technology has spread to a 
                global level in which new companies, places and ideas that need publicity, a representative 
                logo, a web Page and even the necessary equipment to develop, are growing. That is why OnyxCuu 
                will not let that door close so we will take advantage of the opportunity and go as far as we can, 
                helping with our services and products.

            <h1>Features</h1>
            <p>-The creation of a web page
                implementing the idea of the
                client and keeping a constant
                follow-up on it.
                -The creation of logos is based
                on a system in which we offer 3
                sketches which are taught to
                the customer and by choosing
                one and discuss idea,
                -Repair the computers by
                formatting, installing programs,
                updating drivers
                -Repair cell phones, such as the
                screen, sound, charger input
                and more.

        <div class="style">
            <h1>Disadvantages</h1>
            <p>Due to the time that we had for the creation of the page, we cannot count on a 
                public server as we would have wished for the interaction of the public with the page, 
                besides, the learning during the four-month period was not the best so we did not implement 
                functions as important as, for example,  a total security to the site and it only has the basics.
                And as an emerging company, sometimes clients do not accept the possibility of seeing something new, 
                so they reject it, which is why it is difficult to stand out at the beginning.
            </p>

            <h1>Advantages</h1>
            <p>We have excellent advantages, one of them is the creation and use of social network 
                accounts which give them a professional and totally free advertising on facebook and instagram, 
                these have allowed the page to have more visits and become more known. Apart from that, as we 
                mentioned before, the interface is very simple to use, the advantage of having a page gives a
                professionalism to the company, and the other is that our site is totally responsive which allows 
                it to adapt in size to any device.
